# Manual for repository creation
## Repository types
Before creating a new repository, please decide on the type of repository:
* [Repository for education courses](#repository-for-course)
* [Repository for educational projects (for example repositories for projects during M1P course)](#repository-for-educational-project)
* [Repository for research projects](#repository-for-research-projects)
* [Repository for student graduate works](#repository-for-graduate-works)
* [Repositories with examples and templates (examples of neural network scripting, templates for reviews, etc)](#repository-with-examples-and-templates)

If your repository does not match any of the types, you may be doing something wrong. Please [contact the administration of the organization](#contacts) and discuss the purpose of creating your repository.

If your repository falls under more than one type, you are most likely doing something wrong as well. Try to make repositories with only one purpose per repository. There is no need to dump unstructured materials into one repository.
